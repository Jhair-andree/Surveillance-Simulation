# STANAG 4586 compliant surveillance simulator

This project aims to develop a fully functional mission module that can be mounted on a virtual unmanned ground vehicle for simulating ISR missions. The module mimicks functionalities of a real life mission module and supports a variety of sensors, actuators and features which can be remotely controlled by a command and control application. Sensors/actuators currently available include
- Extendable mast
- Electro Optic camera with RTSP feed of the simulated virtual environment
- Laser Range Finder (LRF)
